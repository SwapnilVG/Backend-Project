## Testing with Thunder Client

[Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.io/) is a powerful API testing tool for Visual Studio Code. You can use Thunder Client to test the API endpoints of this backend.

1. Install Thunder Client extension in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open Thunder Client and create a new HTTP request collection.
3. Start testing the API endpoints by sending requests to the corresponding URLs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file.
4. Start the server using `npm start` or `nodemon`.
